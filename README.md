# Discord Bots

### Discord Maze

### Discord Uno
An implementation of the UNO game in discord using a bot written in pure python. 
If you want to play you need:
1) to create a bot in the developer portal and set the auth token in the file **uno.py**
2) install the discord libraries (discord.py) 
3) load on 2 servers the cards (you can find them in the directory called "cards") and let the bot join them.
 
- if you don't like the already splitted cards, in the same directory you will find an image with all cards with background erased and a customizable script to split the image in single cards that can be modifed as you wish. Good luck :D
