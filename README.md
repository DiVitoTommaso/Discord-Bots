# discord-uno
An implementation of the UNO game in discord using a bot written in pure python. 
If you want to play you need to create a bot, install the discord libraries, load on 2 servers the cards (you can find them in the directory called "cards") on two servers and let the bot join them. 
if you don't like the already splitted cards, in the same directory you will find an image with all cards with background erased and a customizable script to split the image in single cards. Good luck :D

- No external libraries needed. Only discord.py need to be installed
